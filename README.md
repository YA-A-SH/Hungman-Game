🎮 Hangman Game (My First Big Logic Project)
This project holds a special place in my heart.
It was the first "serious" challenge I took on when I
started learning Web Development. I followed the logic from Eng.
Osama Elzero's tutorial on YouTube, but I built this version from
scratch with my own touches.

⏳ The Backstory
Built in: April 2025.

Uploaded to GitHub: January 2026.

Wait, why the delay? Well, back in early 2025, I was focused on learning the core of JavaScript and didn't even know how to use Git or GitHub yet! By the time I mastered Git, I was already deep into React and Next.js, so I started uploading my modern projects and totally forgot about my "old gems." I decided to upload this now to document my progress.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Learning Points
I built this using Pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. No frameworks, no libraries—just raw logic.

Heavy on Arrays: I used arrays for almost everything, from splitting the alphabet to managing the secret words.

Math Object: I relied heavily on Math.random() and Math.floor() to pick random categories and words every time the page refreshes.


DOM Manipulation: Creating spans for each letter and toggling classes for the "Hangman" drawing parts was a great lesson in how the browser works.

Note : I used AI to help craft this README to ensure the project description is clear, professional, and straight to the point.

Why no API? Back then, I hadn't learned how to fetch data from APIs yet, so I stored the words in a local Object. It’s simple, but it gets the job done!

🚀 Reflection
Looking back at this code now as a React developer, I can see how much I've grown. But I still appreciate how this project taught me the "hard way" of handling state and UI updates manually.
